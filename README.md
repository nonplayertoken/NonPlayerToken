Non-Player Token (NPCT) started based on the "NPC" (Non-Player Character) meme which became popular within social media circles in recent years.

The token was created on Binance Smart Chain (BSC) with an initial supply of 209,500,000.  The initial price of the token will be $0.06 which produces a conservative market cap of just over $12.5M. 

The majority of tokens (180M) will be listed as an initial exchange offering but as this project is in its infancy, more details about this will be available on our social media profiles. 
  
Unlike the vast majority of other meme coins, we have created a purpose for our token in the form of https://npct.exchange.  Non-Player Tokens will act as the primary governance token for the exchange.

https://npct.exchange is a fork of pancakeswap - an automated market maker (AMM) that will be fully launched in late 2021.  

At present, the Exchange feature on npct.exchange does work and users can add liquidity and trade however as it is a brand new exchange, there is next to no liquidity as of May 2021.

In late 2021, npct.exchange will launch pools and farms where users can earn NPCT tokens by staking LP tokens or one of the available crypto tokens.

Future plans include methods to effectively burn NPCT tokens and reduce supply (NFT's, exchange fees) but more on this will be released in due course.
